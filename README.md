# BlumClicker
BlumAutoClicker is an automated clicking tool designed for Windows. It allows users to target specific windows and automatically perform clicks based on pre-defined conditions, such as detecting specific colors or matching template images within the window. The tool is particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks in applications, such as clicking buttons or detecting objects on the screen.

## Features
1. Color-Based Target Detection: Automatically detect and click on areas of the screen that match a specific color range. For example, this can be used to target specific elements in a game or application.
2. Template Matching: Supports matching and clicking buttons based on template images (e.g., 'Play' and 'Pause' buttons).
3. Configurable Precision: Users can configure the detection precision for color and template matching, allowing for flexibility in different applications.
4. Hotkeys:
  - F6 to start/pause the automation.
  - F8 to exit the program.
  - F10 to decrease volume.
  - F11 to increase volume.
5. Error Logging: Provides detailed logging for errors, such as missing template files or invalid coordinates.
